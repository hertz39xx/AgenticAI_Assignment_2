1. Click a Web Element.
2. Delete existing content in a textbox and then type content. 
3. Scroll up or down. Multiple scrolls are allowed to browse the webpage. Pay attention!! The default scroll is the whole window. If the scroll widget is located in a certain area of the webpage, then you have to specify a Web Element in that area. I would hover the mouse there and then scroll.
4. Wait. Typically used to wait for unfinished webpage processes, with a duration of 5 seconds.
5. Go back, returning to the previous webpage.
6. Google, directly jump to the Google search page. When you can't find information in some websites, try starting over with Google.
