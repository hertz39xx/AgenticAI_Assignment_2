## Setup Environment ##
For this project, you need a environment with <code>python=3.10</code>

For setup env, please do:
```
$ conda create -n webvoyager python=3.10
$ conda activate webvoyager
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Quick Start ## 
First, you need create new file <code>.env</code>, which include:
```
OPENAI_API_KEY = 'YOUR_API_KEY_HERE'
```

Then, you can start this project successfully!
```
$ python run.py
```

## Project introduction ##
**Scenario:** </br>
This is an automated information retrieval and summarization Agentic AI which can help users to obtain key information more efficiently. It’s designed for users who need to quickly acquire and organize information.

**Hoping to solving:**</br>
1.	The time-consuming manual searching work.
2.	Messy and unstructured information sources.

**Core cycle process of Agent:** </br>
- **Environment**
1.	Webpage Data Extraction: Using selenium webdrive to open target website, then using rectangles to mark all the elements’ position and taking a screenshot for later usage.
- **Perception**
1.	According to the screenshot, convert it into base64 and provide the elements to LLM, let it analysis the webpage.
- **Brain**
1. According to the task requirement, LLM will think what element it should interact with to achieve the goal. It will generate the ‘thought’ and ‘action’ based on the prompts and image we gave to it.
1. Then another LLM ‘Reviewer’ will judge the thought and action based on the task. If it think it’s not feasible, then it will provide the reason to the first LLM and make it re-generate thought and action.
- **Action**
1. After get the thought and action, the program will interact will the element LLM chosen. Repeat the loop from environment to action, until the LLM output the label ‘ANSWER’, which means the task is completed.
2. After got the answer, this agent will using the answer to do a search query, then generating a summary which contain positive and negative feedback and finish this task.

## Interact between two-LLM (Agent & Reviewer)
![alt text](image-3.png)
### For example, in the log you can see the process of interaction. The Reviewer will give opinion (Feasibile/Not Feasible) and some reason/suggestion to agent.

### Back to <code>run.py</code>, when reviewer return "Not feasible" it will go to the part which ask the agent re-generate.

## Test Cases ###
### 1. Search the price and product name for the iRocks K85 keyboard(Gray) on PChome.
```
{"web_name": "pchome", "id": "pchome--0", "ques": "Find irocks k85 on pchome. And make sure the color of keyboard is gray. Give the price and name.", "web": "https://24h.pchome.com.tw/"}
```

**Example summary:**
![alt text](image-6.png)
### Results: Successfully searched for iRocks K85 keyboard. But occasionally failed to generated summary correctly, due to the answer’s content.

### 2. Use Google to search for the English name, release date, and publisher of《刺客教條：暗影者》.
```
{"web_name": "google_search", "id": "google_search_task--0", "ques": "Find 《刺客教條：暗影者》's english name, publish date and publisher.", "web": "https://google.com"}
```
![!\[alt text\](results/20250320_04_56_53/taskgoogle_search_task--0/screenshot2.png)
](results/20250320_13_27_29/taskgoogle_search_task--0/screenshot2.png)

**Example summary:**
![alt text](image-4.png)
### Results: Name, publisher and date and be extract correctly, and generate summary successfully.

### 3. StreetVoice Music Ranking Search
```
{"web_name": "street_voice", "id": "street_voice--0", "ques": "Find the songs ranking, then find the most popular song of this week. And make sure that song has more than 100 likes. ", "web": "https://streetvoice.com/"}
```
![!\[alt text\](results/20250320_04_38_17/taskstreet_voice--0/screenshot2.png)](results/20250320_13_29_16/taskstreet_voice--0/screenshot3.png)

**Example summary:**
![alt text](image-5.png)
### Results: Successfully searched for the top song of this week. But occasionally failed to enter the weekly ranking, only stay in the overall ranking.

## TODO LIST:
可能情境:
1) 查詢並非特定產品，可能出現多個結果(如：查詢機械鍵盤)，讓他可以處理多個產品並針對每個產品做懶人包 => 評比工具
2) 爬社群平台的時候應該不需要用到視覺啦(如threads那種文字為主的)
3) 可以考慮輸出總結評比報告(加上產品圖片那種)
